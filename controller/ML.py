Description: The controller here should utilize the implementation
of the swingup mechanism and most likely the following ideas are 
going to be explored:

# Mindset for development:
Observe -> Act -> Reward -> New State
# Decision:
Q-learning or DQN-learning


1. ML solution
2. Pytorch: https://github.com/microsoft/AI-For-Beginners/blob/main/lessons/6-Other/22-DeepRL/CartPole-RL-TF.ipynb
